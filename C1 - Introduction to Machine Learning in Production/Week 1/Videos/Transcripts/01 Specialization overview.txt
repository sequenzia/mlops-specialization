Hi, welcome to this
specialization on machine learning engineering
production, MLOps. Say you've trained an accurate
machine learning model in a Jupyter Notebook, you celebrate that and you
might now be wondering, now what I do. After reaching the milestone
of developing a good model, actually putting your
model into production, so that you have a working
system that is making useful predictions that
requires much more. This specialization will teach
you the skills you need to build and deploy Production
Machine Learning systems. You learn about the
full machine learning project life-cycle from scoping out your project, to data, to modeling through deployment, so you're going to execute
the machine learning project all the way from
start to finish. One common misconception is that the only difference between developing a model that you fit the notebook on your local
machine and deploy that model into production is literally
just the deployment piece, maybe just a bunch of
software engineering. But that's not true, is not just a bunch of
software engineering. There are machine
learning challenges to production as well that on edges in the process of developing a model in
a Jupyter notebook. There is discipline of building and maintaining
production systems, that is the processes and tools for doing all
this is sometimes called MLOps or Machine
Learning Operations and you'll learn about that too. I'm thrilled to be bringing
you this new specialization with two fantastic
instructors from the Google, TensorFlow team, Robert
Crowe and Laurence Moroney. Robert Crowe is a
TensorFlow Developer, Engineer at Google. A Data Scientists at
TensorFlow advocate. Robert has a passion for helping developers quickly
learn what they need, hopefully what you
need to be productive. Laurence Moroney, leads AI
advocacy at Google and is also instructor of three other
TensorFlow specializations with deep learning AI and
is author of the book, "AI and Machine
Learning for Coders". So glad to have both of you with us for the specialization. I'm delighted to
work with you again, it's always a pleasure. As you said Andrew, in
addition to building a first working model
in a production system, you need to handle a
whole range of issues, including things
like data drift, where the distribution
of the data you trained on maybe eventually
become different, very different from
the distribution of the data that you're
running inference on. A key topic that we'll
discuss is change. The world changes and your model needs to be
aware of that change. In this specialization,
we'll also introduce you to several related topics
outside of machine learning. You can look at production
machine learning as both machine learning itself and the
knowledge and skills required in modern
software development. If you're working on a machine learning
team and industry, you really need expertise in both machine learning and
software to be successful. This is because
your team will not just be producing
a single result. You'll be developing
a product or service that will operate continuously and maybe
a mission critical part of your company's work. That's right. I can't say from my own experience
that oftentimes the most challenging
aspects of building machine learning
systems turn out to be the things that you least
expected like deployment. It's all very well being
able to build a model, but getting that into
people's hands and seeing how they use it can be
very eye-opening. You might think you
have the perfect model for the perfect scenario, but your users could
have different opinions, and it's always really
good to learn from them. They might be, for example, okay with a round
robin trips with server for a frequently
updated model. Or they might insist
that their data never leaves their device, so you need to know
the best ways to keep their own device
models really fresh. This specialization
contains four courses that provide you with
the knowledge and hands-on practice to get a production machine learning
system up and running. In the first course
which I teach, you see an overview of the entire life cycle of a production machine
learning project, from the scoping
to getting data, to modeling, to deployment. The second course is all about data and how it
evolves over time. With this course, you'll build data pipelines by
gathering, cleaning, and validating data sets
using TensorFlow extended or TFX, and the TFX
family of libraries. To understand your
data evolution, you'll track changes
with ML metadata using data provenance as a
conceptual framework. The third course is
focused on machine learning modeling
pipelines in production. In this course,
you'll learn how to manage modeling resources to best serve inference
requests and minimize costs. You'll also use analytics
to address model fairness, explainability issues,
and mitigate bottlenecks. Course 4 is all
about deployment. This means of course
that you want to get ready to serve your
users requests. Now this can be exciting and challenging all
at the same time. So in course 4, you'll deliver
deployment pipelines from model serving that might require many different
infrastructures. You'll also apply best
practices to maintain a continuously
operating production system that stays up to date and importantly keeps your users needs front of mind. As a learner in this
specialization, we're assuming that
you're comfortable with Python programming
and Machine Learning, and that you have
some familiarity with one of the deep-learning
frameworks in Python, like TensorFlow,
Keras, or PyTorch. If you've completed the deep
learning specialization offered by DeepLearning.AI, you should be in great shape to start this specialization. Alternatively, of course,
if you've completed the DeepLearning.AI TensorFlow
developer certificate program, you'll be really well-prepared to start the specialization. Great. Well with that,
let's get started. That sounds great to me. Sounds good. Let's do it.
