You've seen the machine
learning project life cycle. Let's briefly go over what you'll learn in the
rest of this course. Even though I presented the life cycle going
from left to right, I found that for learning
these materials, it will be more efficient for you to start at the end goal, and start from deployment, and then work backwards to modeling data and then scoping. In the rest of this week, starting with the next video, you'll learn about the
most important ideas in Deployment. Next week, in Week 2, you'll learn about modeling. You may have learned
about how to train a machine learning model
from other courses. In this video, I'll share some new ideas that you may
not have heard before of how to systematically use
a data-centric approach to be more efficient in how you improve the performance
of your model. Then in the third, and final week of this course, you'll learn about data. How to define data and
establish a baseline, and how to label and organize your data in a way
that is systematic. Not Ad hoc, not hacking around in the Jupyter notebook in the hope that you stumble onto
the right insights, but in a more systematic way that helps you be
more efficient in defining the data that will help the modeling to help
you get to deployment. Then finally, in Week 3 we'll also have an optional
section on scoping. In which I hope to share with
you some tips I've learned on how to define effective
machine learning projects. Throughout this course, you'll
also learn about MLOps, or machine learning operations. Which is an emerging discipline that comprises a set of tools and principles to support progress through the machine ML
project life cycle, but especially these three steps. For example, at Landing
AI, where I'm CEO, we used to do a lot of
these steps manually, which is okay, but slow. But after building
an MLOps tool called LandingLens for computer
vision applications, all these steps
became much quicker. The key idea in MLOps is that systematic ways to
think about scoping, data, modeling, and
deployment, and also software tools to support
the best practices. That's it. In this course, we're going to start
at the end goal, start from deployment, and
then work our way backwards. As you already know, being able to deploy system
is one of the most important, and valuable skills in
Machine Learning today. Let's go on to the next video
where we'll dive deep into the most important ideas needed to deploy machine
learning systems. I will see you in the next video.
