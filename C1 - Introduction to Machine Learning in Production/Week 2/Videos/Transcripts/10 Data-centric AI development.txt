Let's say that error analysis has caused you to decide to focus on improving your learning algorithm's performance on data with
a certain category or tag, say speech with car
noise in the background. Let's take a look
at how you can take a data centric approach to improving your learning
algorithm's performance. You've heard me speak before about model centric versus
data centric AI development. Here's a little more
detail on what I mean. With a model centric
view of AI developments, you would take the
data you have and then try to work really hard to develop a model that does as
well as possible on the data. Because a lot of
academic research on AI was driven by researchers, downloading a benchmark data set and trying to do well
on that benchmark, most academic research
on AI is model centric, because the benchmark data
set is a fixed quantity. In this view, model
centric development, you would hold the data fixed
and iteratively improve. In this model centric view, you would hold the data fixed and iteratively improve
the code or the model. There's still an
important role to play in trying to come up
with better models, but that's a different
view of AI developments which I think is more useful
for many applications. Which is to shift a bit from a model centric to more of
a data centric view. In this view, we think of the quality of the
data as paramount, and you can use tools
such as error analysis or data augmentation
to systematically improve the data quality. For many applications, I find that if your
data is good enough, there are multiple models
that will do just fine. In this view, you can
instead hold the code fixed and iteratively
improve the data. There's a role for model
centric development, and there's a role for
data centric development. If you've been used
to model centric thinking for most of your experience with
machine learning, I would urge you to consider taking a data
centric view as well, where when you're trying to improve your learning
outcomes performance, try asking how can you make
your data set even better? One of the most important
ways to improve the quality of a data set
is data augmentation. Let's go on to the next
video where we'll start to take a look at
data augmentation.
