Say you've identified
the problem, found a worthy solution, finish diligence for
technical feasibility and value and you think
this is worth doing. Let's take a look at
the last steps of the scoping process of
milestones and resourcing. Determining milestones
and resourcing involves writing out the key
specifications for your project. This will include
machine learning metrics such as accuracy or
precision-recall. For some applications,
this may also include fairness
types of metrics. The specification will
often also include software metrics regarding the software system
such as latency, throughput, queries per second, and so on given the computational resources
available, and if possible, you might also write
out estimates of the business metrics you hope to move for the project
you're scoping, such as how much
incremental revenue if you have a way
of estimating that? In addition, writing out the resources needed,
how much data? From which teams? Personnel, any help you need from
cross-functional teams. What software integrations, data leaving support or other support you need from other teams. Finally, the timeline on which you hope to achieve certain milestones
or deliverables. Now, if you're looking at a machine learning project and you find that you're having a very hard time writing on some of these
key specifications, then you might also
consider carrying out a bench-marking exercise
to compare it to other similar projects that others may have worked on before, or building a proof
of concept first in order to get a better sense
of what accuracy, precision, or latency throughput or other
metrics might be feasible, and only after you've done
that POC, proof of concept, to then use that
information to more confidently scope out
the milestones and resources needed for a
larger scale execution of the project you have in mind. That's it. Congratulations
on making it to the end of this
section on scoping. I hope that these
ideas will help you to pick valuable and meaningful
projects to work on. Thank you also for sticking
with me from deployment, through modeling,
through training, all the way back to scoping, and I hope this framework of the full cycle of machine
learning project will also be useful for all the projects I hope
you will build and deploy.
