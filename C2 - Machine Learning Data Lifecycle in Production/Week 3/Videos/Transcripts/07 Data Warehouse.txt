Now we're going to discuss
data warehouses. Fun fact. I once worked in a warehouse, but it wasn't a data warehouse. It was an industrial
tool warehouse. Anyway, let's get
started. Data warehouses. Now let's discuss another popular enterprise
data storage solution. Data warehouses. Data warehouses were
originally developed for big data and business
intelligence applications, but they're also valuable
tools for production ML. A data warehouse is a technology that
aggregates data from one or more sources so that it can be
processed and analyzed. A data warehouse is usually meant for long running batch jobs and their storage is optimized
for read operations. Data entering into the warehouse
may not be in real time. When you're storing data
in a data warehouse, your data needs to follow
a consistent schema. Let's look at some key
features of data warehouses. A data warehouse is
subject oriented and the information
that's stored in it revolves around a topic. For example, data stored in a data warehouse
may be focused on the organization's
customers or vendors, or etc. The data in data warehouse may be collected from multiple
types of sources, such as relational databases
or files and so forth. The data collected in a
data warehouse is usually timestamped to
maintain the context of when it was generated. Data warehouses are nonvolatile, which means the
previous versions of data are not erased
when new data is added. That means that you
can access the data stored in a data warehouse as a function of time and understand how that
data has evolved. Let's look at some advantages
of data warehouses. First, data warehouses
offer enhanced ability to analyze your data by
time stamping your data. A data warehouse can
help maintain contexts. When you store your data
in a data warehouse, it follows a consistent
schema and that helps improve the data quality
and consistency. Studies have shown that the
return on investment for data warehouses tend to be fairly high for many use cases. Lastly, the read and query efficiency from data
warehouses is typically high, giving you fast
access to your data. You're probably familiar
with databases. A natural question is, what's the difference
between a data warehouse and a database? Here are some comparisons. Data warehouses are meant
for analyzing data, whereas databases are often used for transaction purposes. Inside a data warehouse, there may be a delay
between storing the data and the data getting
reflected in the system. But in a database, data is usually available
immediately after it's stored. Data warehouses store data
as a function of time, and therefore, historical
data is also available. Data warehouses are
typically capable of storing a larger amount of data
compared to databases. Queries in data
warehouses are complex in nature and tend to
run for a long time. Whereas queries in database are simple and tend to
run in real time. Normalization is not necessary
for data warehouses, but it should be
used with databases.
