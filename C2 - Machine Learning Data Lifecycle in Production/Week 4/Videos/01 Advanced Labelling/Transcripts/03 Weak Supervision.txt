Now, let's get started
with weak supervision. The final advanced labeling
technique that we'll be covering. This is a quote from Jeff Dean, who leads the machine learning
research group at Google. He's commenting on the cost in terms of
both time and labor, of labeling data. He's also commenting specifically on
the work to create algorithmic approaches the labeling data. That rely on other sources of information,
to produce noisy labels. Weak supervision which we'll discuss now, is the primary way of doing
this kind of labeling. So, what is weak supervision? Well, weak supervision is a way to
generate labels using information from one or more sources. Usually these are subject matter experts,
and usually they're designing heuristics. The resulting labels are noisy rather
than the deterministic labels that we're used to. More specifically weak
supervision comprises one or more noisy conditional
distributions over unlabeled data. And the main objective, is to learn
a generative model that determines the relevance of each
of these noisy sources. So, you start with unlabeled data for
which you don't know the true labels. Then you add to the mix one or
more weak supervision sources. These sources are a list of heuristic
procedures that implement noisy, and imperfect automated labeling. Subject matter experts are the most common
sources for designing these heuristics. Which typically consists
of a coverage set, and an expected probability of the true
label over the coverage set. By noisy we mean that the label has
a certain probability of being correct. Rather than the 100 certainty that were
used to, for labels in our labeled data. The main goal is to learn
the trustworthiness of each supervision source, and this is done by
training a generative model. The Snorkel framework came
out of Stanford in 2016 and is the most widely used framework for
implementing weak supervision. It doesn't require manual labeling, so the system programmatically builds and
manages training data set. Snorkel provides tools to clean model and
integrate the resulting training data rising through the weak
supervision pipeline. Snorkel uses a novel theoretically
grounded techniques, to get the job done promptly and
efficiently. And in addition, Snorkel also offers
data augmentation and slicing. With Snorkel, you'll start with unlabeled
data and apply labeling functions. Which are the heuristics which
are designed by subject matter experts, to generate noisy labels. You'll then use a generative model
to de-noise the noisy labels, and assign importance weights to
the different labeling functions. Finally, you'll train a discriminative
model, your model with a de-noise labels. So let's take a look at
what a couple of simple labeling functions might
look like in code. Here I'll show a simple way to create
functions to label spam using snorkel. The first step is to import
the labeling function from snorkel. And then with this functional label
messages spam, if it contains the word my. This is just an example it's
an easy example to show, so messages with my don't have to be spam. Otherwise the function returns abstained, which means that it has no opinion
on what the labels should be. The second function labels a message
spam if it's longer than five words. So what we're showing here is you were
using multiple labeling functions, to try to arrive at what
the label should be. So let's review a few of the key points
of advanced labeling techniques. Supervised learning requires labeled data,
but labeling data is often an expensive,
difficult, and slow process. Semi-supervised learning is one possible
way to add labels to unlabeled data. So this method falls between unsupervised
learning and supervised learning. It works by combining a small
amount of labeled data with a large amount of unlabeled data. And this improves learning accuracy. Active learning is another
advanced labeling method. It relies on intelligence
sampling techniques, that select the most important examples
the label and add to the data set. Active learning improves predictive
accuracy while minimizing labeling cost. The last method you explored
was weak supervision. Weak supervision leverages noisy,
limited, or inaccurate label sources. Inside a supervised learning environment,
to test labeling accuracy. Snorkel is a compact and user friendly system to manage all
these operations for weak supervision. And establish training data
sets using weak supervision.
