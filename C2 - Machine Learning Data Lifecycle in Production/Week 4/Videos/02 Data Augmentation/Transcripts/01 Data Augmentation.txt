Now let's get started
with data augmentation. In this video I'll talk a bit about
generating synthetic data and then I'll walk through an example of augmenting
images using the CIFAR-10 dataset. And finally I'll mention a few other
advanced techniques for data augmentation. Previously you explored methods for getting more labeled data
by labeling unlabeled data. But another method is to augment your
existing data to create more labeled examples. With data augmentation you expand the
dataset by adding slightly modified copies of existing data or create new
synthetic data from your existing data. With the existing data, it is possible
to create more data by making minor alterations or
perturbations in the existing samples. Simple tasks like flips or rotations and
images are an easy way to double or triple the number of images in a dataset. Here's an example of these
kinds of transformations. Data augmentation is a way to
improve your model's performance, add new valid examples that fall into
regions of the future space that aren't covered by your real examples and
add valid examples in this way, improves coverage of your feature space. Keep in mind that if you add invalid
examples, you run the risk of learning the wrong answer or at the very
least of introducing unwanted noise. So be careful to only augment
your data in valid ways. CIFAR-10, the CIFR-10 dataset,
CIFAR is the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research,
is a collection of images commonly used to train machine learning models and
computer vision models. It's one of the most widely used
datasets for machine learning research. CIFAR-10 contains 60,000
32 by 32 color images. There's 10 different classes
with 6000 images in each class. So let's take a practical look at data
augmentation with the CIFAR-10 dataset. Will add a border padding the image and
that new example is perfectly valid. Will crop the padded images to
a 32 x 32 image and will flip or rotate the padded and cropped images
based on a coin toss or random variable. So the model is not overfitting to
particular rotations or scales. Since color images are tensors,
tensorflow provides very useful functions to perform augmentations
on image datasets. Let's look at a chunk of code that
encapsulates the steps for doing a left, right flip. First we define a function that
will use to augment image datasets. Then we'll use tf.image.resize
with crop_or_pad which allows you to resize or
crop the image. In this case we're going to pad. Tf.image.random crop generates a crop of
size height by width across all channels. And then tf.image.random flip left, right does the same thing with
rotations like flipping left or right. So the function returns the altered
image to be appended to the dataset. Here's some examples after applying the
padding, cropping and left, right flip. Apart from simple image manipulation,
there are other advanced techniques for data augmentation,
such as semi supervised data augmentation such as the unsupervised
data augmentation or UDA. Or other methods using policy based
data augmentation like AutoAugment. On the right,
there's an example of a movie review. And then using policy augmentation,
we generate a variant example. So we have a new example perfectly valid
that we've been able to generate with augmentation. And we can do it again,
we can generate another one. So in summary data augmentation
is a great way to increase the number of labeled
examples in your dataset. It increases the size of your dataset and the sample diversity, which results
in better feature space coverage. Data augmentation can
reduce overfitting and increase the ability of your
model to generalize well.
