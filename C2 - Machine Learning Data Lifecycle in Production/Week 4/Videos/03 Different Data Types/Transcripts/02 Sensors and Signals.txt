Let's review sensor generated data
which is often referred to as signals. Let's start by defining important
terminology by means of an example using a collected
accelerometer data from smartphones. The accelerometer is a sensor signals
are sequences of data collected by a sensor In real time data
points are indexed by time stamps. So therefore this is a time series, this is time series data and
we're going to use time series analysis. So let's look at a concrete problem,
human activity recognition or HAR, can we infer the activity from
the accelerometer patterns in time? Let's look at some of the challenges
of activity recognition. Properly segmenting the sensor data is
key to successful activity recognition. This is similar to the windowing strategy
that we just discussed for weather data. Inertial data like this
fluctuates greatly over time, so segmentation is key to detecting
proper activity chunks. The raw time dependent acceleration
data set is separated into segments during the data
segmentation process. All of the following HAR related
operations, including feature extraction, classification and validation
etcetera are based on these segments. The length of the segments depends
on the application context and sampling rate of the sensors, segments for
HAR are typically 1- 10 seconds long. Now that the data is segmented,
let's talk about typical transformations. The segment of data
should be transformed for modeling because it helps
with model accuracy and performance, there are different ways
to go about transforming your data. A spectrogram of an inertial
signal is a new representation of the signal as a function
of frequency and time. Spectrogram representation
is a powerful method for extracting interpretable features that
represent the intensity differences among different inertial data points. Other options include normalization and
encoding, multichannel processing and
applying a fourier transform. Let's go over what you will
do in the optional notebook, you will try to recognize human
activities from sensor data. The wireless sensor data mining data
set contains data which was collected through controlled laboratory conditions. The data set is a test bench for activity recognition using
cell phone accelerometer data, In this notebook, you'll pre process
the data within a TFX pipeline. There, you will use
tf.data.Dataset.window to group the data into windows, which can be used
with an R N N or similar model. The training and model development is not
implemented on the notebook since we're focusing here on the data itself.
