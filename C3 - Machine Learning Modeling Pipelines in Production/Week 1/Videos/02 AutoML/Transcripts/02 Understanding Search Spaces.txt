Now let's continue our discussion of
AutoML by discussing search spaces. There are two main types of search spaces,
macro and micro. And actually their names are kind of
backwards, but that's what they're called. Let's look at both. First, let's define what we mean by node. A node is a layer in a neural network
like a convolution or pooling layer. In this illustration, each color
represents a different layer type. An arrow from layer LI to LJ indicates that layer LJ receives
the output of LI as input. A macro search space contains
the individual layers and connection types of a neural network. And neural architecture search
searches within that space for the best model,
building the model layer by layer. As shown here, a network can be
built very simply by stacking individual layers referred to
as a chain structured space or with multiple branches and
skip connections in a complex space. By contrast, in a micro search space,
neural architecture search builds a neural network from cells
where each cell is a smaller network. Here are two different types of cells,
a normal cell on the top and a reduction cell on the bottom. Cells are stacked to
produce the final network. This approach has been shown to have
significant performance advantages compared to a macro approach. Here is an architecture built by
stacking the cells sequentially. Note that cells can also be
combined in a more complex manner, such as in multi branch spaces by
simply replacing layers with cells.
