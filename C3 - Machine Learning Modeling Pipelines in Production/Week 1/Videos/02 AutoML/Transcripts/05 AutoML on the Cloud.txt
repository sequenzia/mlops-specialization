One of the easiest ways to use AutoML is by using
a Cloud service. Let's talk about
some of those now. We'll review three
popular offerings; Amazon SageMaker Autopilot, Microsoft Azure Automated
Machine Learning, and Google Cloud AutoML. In the exercises,
you'll train a model using Google Cloud AutoML. Let's begin with Amazon
SageMaker Autopilot. Amazon SageMaker Autopilot
automatically trains and tunes the best machine
learning models for classification or regression
based on your data, while allowing you to maintain full control
and visibility. Starting with your raw data, you select a label or target. Autopilot then searches for candidate models for you
to review and choose from. All of these steps
are documented on executable notebooks
that give you full control and
reproducibility of the process. This includes a leader board of model candidates to help you select the best model
for your needs. You can then deploy the model
to production or iterate on the recommended solutions to further improve model quality. Autopilot is optimized
for quick iteration. It generates high-quality
models quickly. After the initial
set of iterations, autopilot creates
a leaderboard of models ranked by performance. You can see which features in your dataset were
selected by each model. You can then deploy a
model to production. The process of generation of the models is
completely transparent. Autopilot allows you to create a SageMaker notebook from
any model it created. You can then check the
Notebook to dive into details of the models
implementations. If need be, you can
refine the model and recreate it from the Notebook
at any point in time. Amazon suggests that
autopilot can be applied for a number of
different use cases. For example, it can be used
to predict future prices to help you make sound
investment decisions based on your historical data, such as demand, seasonal trends, and the price of
other commodities. Price predictions are
particularly useful in the financial services
sector to predict the price of stocks
or real estate, to predict real estate prices, or energy and utilities to predict the prices of
natural resources. Churn prediction
can be useful in predicting the loss of
customers or churn. Companies are always looking
for ways to eliminate churn. Churn prediction works
by learning patterns in your existing data and
identifying patterns in the new datasets so
that the model can predict which customers
are most likely to churn. Another application
is risk assessment. Risk assessment requires
identifying and analyzing potential events that may
negatively impact individuals, assets, and your company. Risk assessment models
are trained using your existing datasets
so that you can optimize the models
predictions for your business. Next, let's discuss Microsoft Azure Automated
Machine Learning. Microsoft Azure Automated
Machine Learning aims to empower professional and
non-professional data scientists to build machine
learning models rapidly. It automates time-consuming and iterative task of
model development, so basically it does AutoML. It starts with automatic
feature selection, followed by model selection
and hyperparameter tuning on the selected model to generate the most optimized model
for the task at hand. You can either create your
models using a no code UI or using code
first notebooks. You can quickly
customize your models, apply control settings
to iterations, thresholds, validations,
blocked algorithms, and other experimental criteria. It also provides tools to fully automate the feature
engineering process. You can also easily
visualize and profile your data
to spot trends, as well as discover common errors and
inconsistencies in your data. This helps you better understand the recommended actions and
apply them automatically. It also provides intelligent stopping to save time
on computing and prioritize the
primary metric and subsampling to streamline experiment runs
and speed results. It also has built-in support for experiment runs summaries, and detailed metrics
visualizations to help you understand your models and
compare model performance. Model interpretability helps
evaluate model fit for raw and engineered features and provides insights into
feature importance. You can discover patterns,
perform what-if analysis, and develop deeper
understanding of models to support transparency and
trust in your business. Now, let's discuss
Google Cloud AutoML, which you'll be using in
the upcoming exercise. Google Cloud AutoML
is a suite of machine learning products
that enables developers with limited machine-learning
expertise to train high-quality models specific
to their business needs. It relies on Google, state of the art
transfer learning and neural architecture
search technologies. Cloud AutoML leverages
more than 10 years of Google research to help your machine-learning
models achieve faster performance and
more accurate predictions. You can use Cloud AutoML, simple graphical user
interface to train, evaluate, improve, and deploy
models based on your data. You're really only a
few minutes away from your own custom
machine-learning model. Google's human
labeling service can also put a team
of people to work annotating or cleaning
your labels to make sure that your models are being
trained on high-quality data. Because different problems and different data need to
be treated differently, Cloud AutoML isn't
just one thing. It's a suite of
different products, each focused towards particular
use cases and data types. For example, for image data, there's AutoML Vision
and for video data, there's AutoML Video Intelligence,
for natural language, there's AutoML natural language and for translation,
there's AutoML Translation. Finally, for general
structured data, there's AutoML Tables. Some of these are broken
down even further. For image data, for example, there's both vision and classification and
Vision Object Detection. Then there are also
Edge versions of both of these focused on optimizing for running inference
at the edge in mobile applications
or IoT devices. For video, there's both Video
Intelligence classification and video object detection. Again, focused on these
specific use cases. How do all three of these different Cloud services
operate under the hood? Well, no one knows exactly or can't say if they work
for a given provider. However, it is safe to assume
that the algorithms at play will be similar to the ones that we've discussed
in previous lessons. Also, keep in mind that ML
Engineering for Production is a rapidly changing field and new technologies and developments
emerge every few months. These new advancements are
typically incorporated and exploited to their
greatest extent by the AutoML providers. Also notice that these different AutoML
offerings each perform the same operations that you perform or should perform
as you train your model, including feature selection
and feature engineering, and cleaning your labels. AutoML designers understand the importance
of these activities.
