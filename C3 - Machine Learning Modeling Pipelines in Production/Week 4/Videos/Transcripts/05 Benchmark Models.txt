We'll start with a
brief discussion of using benchmarking models, which is always a good
model debugging technique. A good place to start
is by comparing your model to benchmark models. Which are a simple
and powerful way to check your
model's performance. Benchmarking models are small, simple models that are
used before you start development for
baselining your problem. They're generally not
state-of-the-art, but instead are linear
or other simple models with very consistent
performance. You compare your
model to see if it actually is performing
better than the simpler benchmarking
model as a sanity test. If it doesn't, it could be that your model has a problem or that a simple model accurately models the data and is really all that you need for
your application. Once a model passes
the benchmark test, the benchmark model can serve
as a solid debugging tool. Even if you're performing better than the benchmark model, you can still evaluate which test samples
your model is failing. But the benchmark model
predicts correctly. Then you need to study your model to find out
why that's happening.
