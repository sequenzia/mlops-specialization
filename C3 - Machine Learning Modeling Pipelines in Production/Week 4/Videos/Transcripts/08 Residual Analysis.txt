Now let's discuss residual analysis, which is the last model debugging
technique that will cover in this course. Another debugging technique
is Residual Analysis. In most cases this can be used for
regression models, since it requires measuring the distance
between predictions and the ground truth. However, it requires having ground
truth values for comparison, which can be difficult in many online or
real time scenarios. In general, you want the residuals
to follow a random distribution. If you find correlation between residuals, it's usually a sign that
your model can be improved. If you've trained your aggression model, then you're probably familiar with metrics
like root, mean, square, error or RMSE. And similar metrics, residual analysis
uses those kinds of metrics but it primarily looks at
the distribution of the errors. Often using residual plots to visually
inspect the distribution of residuals. If your model is well trained and
has captured the predictive information in the data, then the residuals
should be randomly distributed. However, if you see systematic or
correlated residuals then it tells you that there is predictive information
that the model has not captured. You can then look for
ways to improve your model. So what should you aim for
when performing Residual Analysis? The residuals should not be
correlated with another feature that was available but
was left out of the feature vector. If you can predict the residuals
with another feature, that feature should be included
in the feature vector. This requires checking the unused features
for correlation with the residuals. Also, adjacent residuals should
not be correlated with each other, in other words,
they should not be autocorrelated. If you can use one residual
to predict the next residual, then there's some predictive information
that is not being captured by the model. Often, but not always, you can see
this visually in a residuals plot, ordering can be important for
understanding this. For example, if a residual is more likely
to be followed by another residual that has the same sign, adjacent
residuals are positively correlated. Performing a Durbin Watson test is also
useful for detecting autocorrelation.
