Let's get started with an advanced
approach known as testing concept activation vectors. The interpretation of deep learning
models is a challenge due to their size, complexity and
often opaque internal state. In addition, many systems,
such as image classifiers operate on low level features rather
than high level concepts. To address these challenges, the team at google introduced concept
activation vectors, or CAVs, which provide an interpretation of
a neural networks internal state. In terms of human friendly concepts,
high level human friendly concepts are defined using
sets of example input data for the model under inspection, for
instance, to define the concept curly, a set of images of hairstyles and texture
of images can be used for an image model. Note that these examples are not
constrained to training data. They can be defined using
new user provided data, examples have been shown to be
effective means of interfacing with models for both expert and
non expert users. You can use concept activation
vectors to sort examples or in this case images with respect to
their relationship to a concept. This is useful for qualitative
confirmation that the concept activation vectors correctly reflect
the concept of interest. As a concept,
activation vector encodes the direction of a concept in the vector
space of a bottleneck. We can compute cosine similarity
between a set of pictures of interest to the casine activation vector
in order to sort the pictures. Note that the pictures being assorted are
not used to train the concept activation vector. Shown here are two concepts of
interest CEO and model women and images that have been sorted
by similarity to the concept. On the left are sorted images of stripes
with respect to a concept activation vector learned from a more abstract
concept CEO collected from image net. The top three images are the most
similar to the CEO concept and look like pinstripes, which may relate to
the ties or suits that a CEO may wear. Which provides confirmation of
the idea that CEOs are more likely to wear pinstripes than horizontal stripes. I'm told that horizontal stripes
can look unprofessional, but I'm hardly a fashion expert,
which you can tell by the way I dress. On the right are sorted images
of neckties with respect to a model women concept activation vector. Again, the top three images
are the most similar to the concept, which in this case is model women and
show women in neckties, but all of the bottom three
images show men in neckties. This also suggests that concept
activation vectors can be a standalone similarity sworder to sort images to
reveal any biases in the example, images from which the concept
activation victor is learned.
