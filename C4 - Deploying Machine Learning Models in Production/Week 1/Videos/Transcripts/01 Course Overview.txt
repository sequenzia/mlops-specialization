Welcome to this fourth and final course
in the machine learning engine for production and Emma of specialization. The first course had covered the high
level overview of the entire machine learning project lifecycle, from scoping
the data to modeling to deployment. The second course centered around data for
production environments and building data pipelines for production Ml. The third course went to the building and maintaining production grade
machine learning models. This fourth course will bring all
the modules covered so far together so that you learn how to ensure a reliable
deployment of your production system. Managing deployed systems is quite
a challenge as it requires making changes, maybe even while the system
continues to serve infants requests. This course focuses on
modern Morozov's practices. They'll let you do this effectively and
efficiently. I'm thrilled to reintroduce this
cause's instructors, Robert Crow, whose tend to fill developer engineer
google and the world expert in MAS. As well as Laurence Maroney,
who has AI advocacy at Google and teach three other TensorFlow
specializations with deep learning AI. >> This course focuses on production
systems and applications. That includes the issues and
methodologies for designing, deploying and maintaining systems software,
data and models. This is where things get real
where you stand up systems, load models and serve requests. In this course, you'll serve models and
deliver batch and real time inference results by building
scalable and reliable infrastructure. You'll implement techniques to run
inference on both edge devices and applications running in a web browser. You'll also coordinate model
management delivery by managing model version's lineage and registries. You'll implement continuous integration
and delivery for model deployment and maintain and monitor a continuously
operating production system. You'll even implement Ml
processes pipelines and workflow automation that adhere
to modern Ml ops best practices. Which will allow you to manage and audit your projects during
their entire life cycle. You'll establish procedures
to detect model decay and prevent reduced accuracy,
including monitoring and logging. >> So thanks Robert and
as Robert Andrew said, this is really where
it begins to get real. And one of the things that you're going to
be doing in this course is to expand on the tools that you've learned in the
classroom to go beyond the classroom and start using these tools in the real world. You're going to be looking at serving
technologies and infrastructure. You're going to be looking at scaling
methodologies, and you're also going to be looking at the different ways that you
can deploy your models in production. And this goes all the way
from tiny models and embedded systems through light models and
mobile systems. JavaScript models running in the browser
and then of course your main models that can run on a server, be it in a server
infrastructure or a cloud infrastructure. And there's so many different types of deployed systems
that you're going to learn about. There's going to be some fun stories,
for example, of how to scale models and one example I had of being needing to
scale an application to deal with the fans of a very popular boy band. And the impact of trying to scale for
that. And then also with models, for example how you may need to change
them dynamically on the fly. For something like a recommender system, where there may be changes where
new products become available. Our new trends suddenly hit, and you want
to be able to update your recommended systems on the flight
to be able to do that. So there's lots of great
stuff in this course. Why don't we just get started? >> Thanks, rather than Lawrence. I'm excited about this cause that connects
all the machine learning production pipeline components together. Anyone building production machine
learning systems will benefit from knowing these techniques for
managing and monitoring systems after
deployment to the learner. This course to set you up to implement
modern Emma of practices and tackle production machine
learning challenges. Let's dive into deploying
production pipelines.
