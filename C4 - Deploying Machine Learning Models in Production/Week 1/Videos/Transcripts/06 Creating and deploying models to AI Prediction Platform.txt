Yeah, let's go through a cold lab for
building and deploying an extra boost model
on the cloud AI platform. Let's do a walk through first on
the google cloud platform console, scroll down until you see the AI. Platform entry from here,
select dashboard and you'll be taken to the AI platform dashboard,
select models from the list on the left. You may see that you need to
enable the api to create a model, select that and wait for
the progress to complete. Once it's done, find the compute engine
entry in the left navigation menu and if it isn't enabled to be
sure to enable it with this button it may take a while and
have sped it up here. Once it's done, return to the AI
platform entry in the navigation and find notebooks. Once it opens you'll see a list of
notebooks and it's probably empty so go to new instance at the top, select python
three, accept the default and hit create you'll see a new entry in the list and it
may take a few moments before it's ready. I sped up the video here when it's done
you'll see a link to open Jupiter lab, select it and the Jupiter environment
will open up with a number of options, select the terminal option
within the terminal. You can then pick three, install XG boost
like this when it's done you can now open a new python three Notebook. The code lab will give you all this code
so don't worry if you don't see it right now as you create the code and again it's
in the cold lab which you'll see next. You can run it cell by cell, the first couple of cells allow
you to inspect the data and as you run through you'll see how you
can create an ex KGB regressive for this data which will give you predicted
weights versus actual weights for babies. You can then save this model
as a tensorflow saved model, the model can then be deployed to
GCP nope that you have GCP project. And then the ID can be found by
selecting your project at the top and finding it in the list of
projects that you are. The motto bucket is a storage bucket
that you can name with the model bucket variable. And after you make it you can see that
you can copy the saved model to it, you can explore your cloud
storage to find the bucket. And then within that you'll see
the safe model running the G cloud AI platform models create, will create
the AI platform model for you and G cloud AI platform versions create will
deploy a version for you when it's done. You can then look at your models list and
refresh it and you should see that
the baby model is there. We have one version called V one and
now we can write some simulated data to adjacent file and use
the endpoint to get predictions for it. So now it's your turn try out the cold lab
to see if you can repeat what I've done.
