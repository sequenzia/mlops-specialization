Anonymization and pseudonymisation are some of the most well
established ways of protecting privacy. So let's discuss them now, the GDP are includes many regulations
to preserve privacy of user data and includes the definitions of
many of the terms that it uses. This includes two terms that I'll discuss
now anonymization and pseudonymisation. Anonymization removes personally
identifiable information or P II from data sets so that people who the data describes
remain anonymous for the GDPR. Recital 26 defines acceptable data
anonymous station to be irreversible and done in such a way that is
impossible to identify the person. It's impossible to derive insights or discrete information even by the party
responsible for anonymization. Once data has been
acceptably anonymous sized, the GDP are no longer
applies to that data. Pseudonymisation is a bit different. This is a reversible process,
meaning that it's still possible to identify the individual if the right
additional information is included. Pseudonymisation can be
implemented with data masking or encryption or tokenization. It relies on careful control of access to
the additional identifying information. So to be clear the biggest
difference between anonymization and pseudonymisation is that
pseudonymized data can be reversed using an additional
set of information or an encryption key while
anonymization is irreversible. A lot of methods, mechanisms and
tools have been developed over the years that produce data with
various levels of both anonymity and the capability of being identified. It ranges from personally
identifiable to truly anonymous data, personally identifiable data contains
name, address, phone, email etc. While data which is purely anonymous and in accordance with GDP are guidelines
does not include personally identifiable information or PI and
cannot be connected to PII. Even with additional information,
pseudonymized and de identified data form the intermediary
category of the spectrum. They are indeed a way of preserving
certain aspects of data privacy but not to the level of truly anonymous data. Note however, that the difference
between de identified data and pseudonymized data is not well defined and many discussions will group
them together as one thing. So what part of your data should
you anonymized basically everything that is part of PI that includes any
data that reveals the identity of a person which are known as identifiers
and with the term identifiers. I mean any natural or
legal person living or dead including their dependents,
their ascendance and descendants. This also includes other related
persons who might be identifiable through either direct or
indirect relationships. For example, this includes
features such as family names, patron names first names,
maiden names, aliases, address phone, bank account details, credit cards,
tax IEDs and so forth.
