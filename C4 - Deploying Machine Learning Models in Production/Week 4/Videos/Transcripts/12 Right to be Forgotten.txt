I'm sorry, who are you again? Never mind. Anyway, it turns out that you have
a right to be forgotten. Let's discuss that
now, shall we? First, some
clarification of terms. When the GDPR refers
to a data subject, it means a person, and when
it refers to a controller, it means a person or organization
who has control over a dataset containing Personally Identifiable
Information or PII. Now that we've got
that out of the way, let's ask the question. When does a person have
the right to be forgotten? Well, there's a fairly long
list of reasons for why an individual has the right to have their personal data erased. Rather than trying
to remember these, I encourage you to
refer to the GDPR. The list includes the
personal data is no longer necessary for the
purpose an organization originally collected
it or processed it, or an organization is relying
on individual's consent as the lawful basis for
processing the data and that individual
withdraws their consent, or an organization is relying
on legitimate interests as its justification for processing an individual's data and the individual objects
to this processing, and there is no overriding
legitimate interest for the organization to
continue with the processing, or an organization is
processing personal data for direct marketing purposes and the individual objects
to this processing, or an organization processed an individual's personal
data unlawfully, or an organization must erase personal data in order to comply with a legal ruling
or obligation, or an organization has processed a child's personal data to offer them information
society services, an information society might be a social network, for example. If any of those
conditions are met, you must delete
the person's data. In general, these are
mostly common sense. However, in some cases, an organization's
right to process someone's data might override their right to be forgotten. Here are the reasons
cited in the GDPR that override the
right to be forgotten. The data is being
used to exercise the right of freedom of
expression and information, or the data is being used to comply was a legal
ruling or obligation, or the data is being used to perform a task
that is being carried out in the public
interest or when exercising an organization's
official authority, or the data being
processed is necessary for public health purposes and serves in the public interest, or the data being
processed is necessary to perform a preventative
or occupational medicine, this only applies when the
data is being processed by a health professional
who is subject to a legal obligation of
professional secrecy, or the data represents important information that
serves the public interest, scientific research,
historical research, or statistical purposes where the eraser of the data
would be likely to impair or halt progress towards the achievement that was
the goal of the processing, or the data is being used
for the establishment of a legal defense or in the
exercise of other legal claims. Furthermore, an
organization can request a reasonable fee or
deny a request to erase personal data if the
organization can justify that the request
was unfounded or excessive. But, in general, you should avoid overriding
an individual's right to be forgotten unless you strongly meet one of these conditions. When in doubt err on
the side of privacy. You also have the right to have your personal information
corrected or rectified. This might be important in situations like your
credit history, health history, or
employment history. The GDPR also defines a
number of other rights which people or
data subjects have. These include the right of
access by the data subject, the right to restriction
of processing, the right to data portability, and the right to object. As a general rule, it's best to err on the side
of privacy and consider any personal
information that you have in your data as sensitive. You should restrict access
to it and keep it safe. Above all, you should think of it as the property of the person whose information it is
and honor their wishes. When you receive a
valid request to have personal
information deleted, you need to identify
all of the information related to the content
requested to be removed, you also need to
identify and remove all of the metadata
associated with that person. If you've run any analysis
or trained any models, the derived data and logs, and models must also be
removed or corrected. The goal here is as
much as possible to make it as if you
never had their data. There are basically two ways
to delete data which will satisfy the requirements
of the GDPR: First, you can anonymize the data, which as you saw previously, will make it non personally identifiable under the
terms of the GDPR, and the GDPR will no longer
apply to anonymize data. Second, you can do a
hard delete of the data, meaning actually
delete the data, including any rows in your database which
might contain it. Normally, your
first impulse might be to always just
do a hard delete, but often there are
issues with that. Anonymization is another option. In a database or any other
similar relational datastore, deleting records
can cause havoc. Part of this is
because user data is often referenced in
multiple tables, so deleting those records
breaks the connections, which can be difficult, especially in large
complex databases. For example, it can
break foreign keys. On the other hand, anonymization keeps the records
and only anonymizes the fields containing PII while still satisfying the
requirements of the GDPR. There are several challenges in implementing the right
to be forgotten: The process of identifying whether or not data privacy has been violated is itself
a challenging task, in order to enforce the GDPR, several organizational
changes are needed, including policy changes and training employees in how to enforce the right
to be forgotten, and one last consideration,
that can be tricky; if your organization maintains multiple backups of your data, which actually you should, making sure that your personal
data has been deleted from all of your
backups is challenging. You might very well have to
change your data storage and backup implementation to
maintain compliance with a GDPR. Issues like GDPR and the
right to be forgotten are already important to operating in a
business environment. Understanding the machine
learning issues around them will only get
increasingly important. We've given you a
basic understanding of today's reality in this area, but I strongly
encourage you to keep watching for new developments. Also, I think it's
always important to respect the privacy
of your customers and treat any information or PII that you have
with great care, and I strongly
encourage you to do so.
