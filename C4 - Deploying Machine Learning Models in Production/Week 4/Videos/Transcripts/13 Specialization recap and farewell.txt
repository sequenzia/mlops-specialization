Well, you've done it. You've reached the end of
the specialization, congratulations. Just a few parting thoughts,
first, as you clearly know by now, this is a field which involves a broad
range of technologies and disciplines. We've covered a lot, but there's much more to learn about and
explore and that's a good thing. I hope we've given you the tools
to enable you to explore and learn more about this
field in an informed way. You've probably noticed that for many of
the topics, we've only given you a high level understanding of the topic and where
it fits in the world of production ML. That was necessary, since going
into depth in all of these topics would have required a much longer
series of courses and leaving them out would have left you uninformed
about major topics in this field. So now, in some ways,
your journey really starts and since it's a journey with no real end,
I'm traveling it with you. See you out there and
again, congratulations.
